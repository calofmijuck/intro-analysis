The gamma function
\[
    \Gamma(x) = \int_{0}^{\infty} t^{x-1}e^{-t} \d{t}
\]
is the unique function that satisfies the following properties.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \(\Gamma(x + 1) = x \Gamma(x)\).
    \item \(\Gamma(1) = 1\).
    \item \(\log \Gamma\) is convex.
\end{enumerate}

\defn. \note{Borel Set} \(A\) is a \textbf{Borel set} if there exists a countable collection of open\footnote{closed도 가능하다.} sets \(\seq{A_n}_{n=1}^\infty\) such that \(A = A_1 \circ A_2 \circ A_3 \circ \cdots\) where each \(\circ\) is any of \(\cup, \cap, \bs\).

The collection \(\mf{B}\) of all Borel sets in \(\R^p\) is a \(\sigma\)-ring. Borel \(\sigma\)-algebra has the following properties.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \(\R^p \in \mf{B}\).
    \item \(A\cup B \in \mf{B}\) for any \(A, B \in \mf{B}\).
    \item \(A \bs B \in \mf{B}\) for any \(A, B \in \mf{B}\).
\end{enumerate}

\defn. \note{Borel \(\sigma\)-algebra} \textbf{Borel \(\sigma\)-algebra} is the smallest \(\sigma\)-algebra containing all open sets in \(\R^p\).

Check that the two definitions are equivalent!

\prob. Show that if \(f:\R \ra \R\) is differentiable, then \(f'\) is measurable.

\prob. Let \(f: \R \ra \R\) be bounded, continuous and \(f(x) \neq 0\). Show that \(g(x) = \ds\int_0^x f(t) \d{t}\) is measurable.
