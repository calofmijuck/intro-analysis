Notes from Introduction to Analysis Course

## Introduction to Analysis 1

- [analysis1-notes.pdf](/analysis1-notes.pdf): Notes from Introduction to Analysis 1 Course
  - Instructor: Professor Insuk Seo
  - Taken in 2019 Spring.
- Homeworks and solutions included.
- Some notes from the lectures in March are missing.
  - I used to taken notes on paper, and I think I switched to TeX somewhere around the end of March.
  - I tried to fill the missing notes, but I was too busy.
- Watch out for inconsistent document styles! The notes were _taken during class_ with TeX!

## Introduction to Analysis 2

- [analysis2-notes.pdf](/analysis2-notes.pdf): Notes from Introduction to Analysis 2 Course
  - Instructor: Professor Panki Kim
  - Taken in 2022 Fall.
- Homeworks and solutions included.
- Took this class 3 years after taking Analysis 1, due to military service.
- Has better document style and is more readable, compared to analysis1-notes.pdf.
- A Korean translation is on my blog. ([Link](https://calofmijuck.tistory.com/category/Mathematics/Measure%20Theory))
  - I put a lot of effort to the figures in each article, hoping to provide some geometrical explanation for the content.
  - But I'm not sure when I will finish translating this.
- Since high school, one of my goals of studying math was to study Lebesgue integration, and I am very happy that I have accomplished this.
  - TMI: The other goals are: Galois theory (unsolvability of the quintic), Stokes' theorem (the general one).
